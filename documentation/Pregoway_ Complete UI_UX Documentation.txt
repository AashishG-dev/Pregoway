Pregoway: Predictive Maternal Health System
Blueprint Document v1.1
Executive Summary
Pregoway is not a pregnancy tracker—it's a predictive maternal mortality prevention system powered by
adaptive AI. While existing apps track appointments, Pregoway predicts complications 2-4 weeks before they
become life-threatening and dynamically adjusts the pregnancy journey to prevent maternal and infant deaths.
The Problem: 45,000 Indian women die annually during pregnancy. 60% of these deaths are predictable but
currently go undetected until emergency situations arise.
Our Solution: An AI system that learns from daily patient interactions, analyzes patterns invisible to human
observation, and intervenes before complications become fatal.
Market Gap: No existing system combines predictive analytics, adaptive journey planning, and inclusive
design for rural India.
Core Innovation: What Doesn't Exist Yet
1. Predictive Risk Engine (Not Reactive Tracking)
Current Systems: Track appointments, send reminders (reactive)
Pregoway: Predicts pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes, hemorrhage risk, fetal distress 2-4 weeks before
clinical diagnosis
How: AI analyzes micro-trends in blood reports, daily symptom patterns, vital sign velocities that doctors miss
Example: Patient reports "mild headache" 3 days in a row + BP rising 2mmHg weekly + slight hand swelling
→ AI flags 68% pre-eclampsia probability → Immediate intervention scheduled
2. Adaptive Journey Replanning (Dynamic Protocol Adjustment)
Current Systems: Fixed 9-month appointment schedule
Pregoway: Journey changes in real-time based on risk evolution
How: If gestational diabetes detected at Week 20 (vs standard Week 28 test), entire remaining journey auto-
adjusts: adds dietician, extra scans, changes delivery hospital to NICU-equipped facility
Impact: Proactive management vs crisis response
3. Multi-Modal Pattern Recognition
Current Systems: Analyze single data points (BP reading, glucose level)
Pregoway: Combines 15+ data streams to detect danger patterns
Data Sources:
Lab report trends (velocity of change, not just values)
Daily symptom progression
Sleep quality patterns
Fetal movement changes
Weight gain acceleration
Voice stress biomarkers (future)
Medication adherence
Even weather/season (heat stress correlation)
Example: Individual symptoms seem minor, but combination triggers alert: fatigue + reduced fetal movement +
pale complexion in photos = anemia + possible fetal distress
4. Rural India-First Design (Truly Inclusive)
Current Systems: English-only, assume typed digital reports, require constant internet
Pregoway Innovations:
Handwritten Report Input: Take photo of doctor's handwritten prescription/report → AI extracts data in
12+ Indian languages
Manual Data Entry: Family member can input data if patient is illiterate
Voice-First Interface: Answer questions by speaking in Hindi/Tamil/Bengali/Telugu/Marathi/Gujarati
Offline-First Architecture: All features work without internet, sync when available
SMS Fallback: Critical alerts via SMS if no app access
Shared Device Model: One family device can manage multiple pregnancies
Low Data Consumption: < 5MB monthly data usage
5. Intelligent Document Locker with Auto-Extraction
Current Systems: Store PDFs, require manual reading
Pregoway:
Smart OCR: Extracts values from lab reports (typed or handwritten) in any Indian language
Auto-Trending: Tracks hemoglobin, BP, glucose, thyroid across all reports automatically
Visual Alerts: "Your hemoglobin dropped 15% in 2 weeks" with graph
Doctor Comparison: Highlights abnormal values with color coding
Family Sharing: Controlled access for husband/mother to view reports
6. Daily Adaptive Questionnaire (Gets Smarter)
Current Systems: Fixed daily questions for all users
Pregoway: AI asks different questions based on individual risk profile
How It Adapts:
Low-risk patient: 5 basic questions (sleep, fetal movement, energy)
High-risk patient: 12 targeted questions (vision changes, swelling severity, headache location)
Questions change based on yesterday's answers
If patient reports new symptom, follow-up questions appear next day
Compliance Gamification: Streaks, badges, weekly summary for motivation
7. Predictive Alerts (Before Crisis Happens)
Current Systems: Alert after problem occurs (reactive)
Pregoway: Warns 2-7 days before symptoms worsen
Examples:
"Based on your BP trend, you might experience severe headaches by Friday. We've scheduled urgent
check-up tomorrow."
"Your baby's movement pattern has shifted. This could indicate distress. Do kick count test now."
"Hemoglobin dropping rapidly. Expect extreme fatigue this weekend. Iron supplements prescribed."
8. Doctor AI Co-Pilot Dashboard
Current Systems: Doctors read reports manually
Pregoway: AI highlights critical patterns, suggests interventions
Features:
Risk Summary: "Patient X - 67% pre-eclampsia probability based on 14-day trend"
Automated Flags: "Urgent: Fetal movement reduced 40% in 3 days"
Treatment Suggestions: "Consider prescribing aspirin to reduce pre-eclampsia risk (evidence-based)"
Compliance Tracking: "Patient missed 3 medications this week - intervention needed"
Outcome Prediction: "If current trajectory continues, C-section recommended by Week 37"
9. Family Caregiver Network Integration
Current Systems: Only patient gets information
Pregoway: Involves support system proactively
Features:
Husband/Mother Dashboard: Simplified view of patient status
Task Assignments: "Ensure she takes iron tablet after lunch today"
Emergency Protocols: "If she reports these 3 symptoms, take her to hospital immediately"
Appointment Reminders: Family gets reminders to arrange transportation
Risk Escalation: "Her risk score increased - watch for warning signs"
10. Hyperlocal Hospital Routing
Current Systems: Patient chooses hospital
Pregoway: AI recommends hospital based on risk + capability
How:
Low-risk pregnancy → Nearby clinic adequate
High-risk (twins, pre-eclampsia) → Routes to hospital with NICU, blood bank, specialist
Emergency mode → Finds nearest facility with ICU bed availability in real-time
Considers: Distance, traffic, hospital equipment, doctor availability

Success Stories (Projected Scenarios)
Scenario 1: Pre-Eclampsia Prevention
Patient: Priya, 28, first pregnancy, Week 24
AI Detection: BP rising trend + protein in urine + mild headaches = 72% pre-eclampsia risk
Intervention: Doctor prescribes aspirin, schedules weekly monitoring, plans early delivery at equipped hospital
Outcome: Controlled pre-eclampsia, baby delivered healthy at Week 37 via planned C-section
vs Standard Care: Without early detection, emergency C-section at Week 32, NICU admission, higher costs
Scenario 2: Gestational Diabetes Caught Early
Patient: Anjali, 32, overweight, family history of diabetes, Week 18
AI Detection: Weight gain velocity + fatigue pattern + thirst increase = 68% GDM probability
Intervention: Early glucose test (instead of Week 28), diet modification, glucose monitoring
Outcome: Controlled GDM, normal delivery, healthy baby
vs Standard Care: Undiagnosed until Week 28, baby macrosomia (large), emergency C-section
Scenario 3: Rural Access Success
Patient: Lakshmi, 22, village in Bihar, limited smartphone access, illiterate
Solution: ASHA worker uses shared tablet, inputs Lakshmi's handwritten reports via photo OCR
AI Detection: Severe anemia detected from pale conjunctiva in photo + fatigue reports
Intervention: Iron infusion arranged, blood transfusion readiness at district hospital
Outcome: Anemia corrected before delivery, safe birth
vs Standard Care: Anemia undetected, hemorrhage during delivery, maternal death
Conclusion: Why Pregoway Will Win
Pregoway is not incremental innovation—it's a paradigm shift.
We're moving maternal healthcare from:
Reactive → Predictive
Tracking → Preventing
One-size-fits-all → Personalized
Urban-only → Inclusive
Doctor-dependent → AI-augmented
The market is massive: 26 million pregnancies annually in India alone.
The impact is measurable: We can directly attribute lives saved.
The moat is defensible: Clinical validation + proprietary dataset + regulatory approval = 3-5 year lead.
The timing is perfect: AI capabilities just reached reliability threshold, smartphone penetration hitting rural
India, government digitizing healthcare.
This is the future of maternal healthcare. Pregoway makes it reality today.
